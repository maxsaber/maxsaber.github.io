While I was on the west coast for my old college roommate's wedding, I figured I would take the opportunity to visit Seattle. It had been YEARS since I've been to the Pacific Northwest before, and I was quickly reminded why I wasn't disappointed last time I visited. Seattle is a beautiful city, and I would love to go back and spend more time there.

Seattle, Washington is a city known for its beautiful natural scenery, vibrant culture, and unique attractions. With a wide variety of parks, neighborhoods, and landmarks to explore, it's no wonder that Seattle is a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. In this travel recap, we'll take a closer look at some of the sights I got to see and explore in Seattle, including Marina Beach Park, Edmonds Bowl, Stamm Overlook, Lowman Beach Park, and Capitol Hill.

SoulCycle is a fitness company that offers high-intensity indoor cycling classes. Their South Lake Union location is one of the newest additions to the Seattle fitness scene, and it's quickly become a popular destination for those who want to break a sweat and have fun doing it. The studio is located in the trendy South Lake Union neighborhood, which is home to many tech companies and startups. I had the ABSOLUTE pleasure of riding with one of my oldest Soul friends, Tommy! Tommy and I go way back to when he was working at the Boston Back Bay studio while I was riding there. You never know the vibe of his class until he starts his playlist, but I can guarantee you that it will be a good one. He's a great instructor, and I'm so proud of him for growing into the confident and talented instructor he is today.

While I was in town, Tommy was nice enough to let me stay at his apartment one night when I spontaneously decided to extend my trip. I had a great time exploring the city with him, and I'm so grateful for his hospitality. The fact that I *finally* got to meet Charlie was a huge bonus! This was probably the most difficult picture of the whole weekend, this little guy has so so much chaotic energy, every picture he was in, he was just a blur!

I had a great time exploring Seattle, and I can't wait to go back and explore more of the Pacific Northwest. If you're planning a trip to Seattle, I highly recommend checking out some of the places I visited. I promise you won't be disappointed!

And of course, *very* special thank you Tommy for being the **BEST** Seattle tour guide there is even if we spent too much money shopping on the last day of the trip and I almost couldn't fit everything in my suitcase home :)
