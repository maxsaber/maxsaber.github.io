Off to Charlotte, NC for the first time for a  wedding – I had a great time being a +1! While there weren’t too many pictures taken during this trip this panorama from The Green in downtown Charlotte was my favorite shot. The Green is a literary-themed “pocket park” next to the Mint Museum and the Bechtler Museum of Modern Art.
