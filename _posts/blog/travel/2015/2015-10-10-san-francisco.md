On my second annual Columbus Day weekend trip to California I went to visit some of my best friends who got the bug and moved out there. Needless to say I had a fantastic time and I cannot wait for Columbus Day 2016 to get here!

* The Painted Ladies
* Smitten Ice Cream
* Palace of Fine Arts
* Golden Gate Bridge
* Big Sur
* Apple Headquarters (wasnâ€™t on the plan but I put it there)
* Castro District
* Carmel-by-the-Sea
* Trefethen Vineyards
* Andretti Winery
* Turnbull Winery
* UC Botanical Gardens
* Sutro Baths
* Ocean Beach
* Twin Peaks Park
