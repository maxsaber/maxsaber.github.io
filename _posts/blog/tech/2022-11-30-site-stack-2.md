Welcome back for part II!

In the first of a three(?) part post, I'm going to discuss the foundational components of this site, where I found them, and why I happend to select a particular technology.

## What functionality did I _add_ to the existing site?

In building certain areas of the site I tried to repliate some functionality from my old personal website that used [Brizy.io][brizy] as a CMS layered on a WordPress site. Since this new site uses [Jekyll][jekyll], some things like photo galleries, comment sections, and web forms presented a bit of a challenge. Searching the web for the right kind of image gallery, I came across the [Image Gallery][image-gal] include from Jekyll Codex that nicely formats and displays a folder of specific images. This include uses an image resizing and cache service from [wsrv.nl][weserv] which also happens to leverage the CloudFlare CDN network.
