**FINALLY** DONE! Today's the day I graduate with my Doctorate in Healthcare Administration from the Medical University of South Carolina! It was quite the journey from start to finish, I made a group of lifelong friends and colleagues, and I'm excited to see what the future holds. I was also so excited to finally bring my Mom to Charleston and take her and my family to all of my favorite places I've been over the past few years.

First of all, I have to start by saying I'm so grateful for all of the support I've received from my family, friends, and colleagues over the past few years. The Doctorate journey isn't everyone's cup of tea, and that's **perfectly** ok! I knew though it was the right path for me, and I'm so glad I stuck with it. I had my moments where I questioned why on earth would anyone do this to themselves, but I always came back to the fact that I wanted to be a better healthcare leader, and I wanted to be able to help others in a more meaningful way. Technology is great, yes, but it's not going to replace the human touch. I've always wanted to help people in ways technology can't; this degree allowed me to take my technical and clinical backgrounds together and become a unique leader in the healthcare space.

Typically I would just toss all of the photos I wanted from the event into a gallery, but these deserve a bit more attention!

Max with Goose at the MUSC sign. I'm not sure if he was there to congratulate me or to eat my diploma (clearly he saw something at the bakery across the street with those eyes), but I'm glad he was there! I took my first on-campus picture in front of this sign before I left our orientation, it only seemed appropriate to take my last on-campus picture in front of it as well!
