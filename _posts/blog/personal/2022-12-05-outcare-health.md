I'm thrilled to say that I've been selected and added to the [OutCare Health Mentorship directory][directory]! Mentors in the OutCare Health make themselves available to offer school, career, or research advice, and guidance on many other life pursuits to LGBTQ+ students and professionals.

<!--more-->

All OutCare Health mentors must:

- Provide mentorship for mentees who either identify as LGBTQ+ themselves and/or are interested in LGBTQ+ equity,
- Be affirming to provide appropriate mentorship and guidance,
- Avoid assumptions of sexual orientation, gender identity, and related biases,
- Create welcoming, collaborative mentor-mentee relationships and safe space environments.[^1]
