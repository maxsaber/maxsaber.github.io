Phewwwwww what a year 2022 has been... I feel like we say this every every year but boy I can't wait for 2023. 2023 is going to be my year, I can feel it! As with any of my other posts, I totally expect no one to read this and I'm writing it for myself. But if you do read it, I hope you enjoy it! Here a recap of Max's 2022

## The Serious

**COVID, still...** 2022 started just as the year before did with COVID-19 ever so present in all of our lives, but this time we were preparing to bring students back to campus. Let me tell you, for a fairly small school in comparison to some of the ones around, it was a logistical nightmare.

One thing I was grateful for was all the time I got to spend with my favorite dog, Mr. Goose!

**May:** Holy cow, can you believe it's already been a year since I finished my doctorate? I certainly can't and I still forget that I'm Dr. Max Saber. I'm still not sure what I'm going to do with it, but I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually.

This May also brought around my 10th service anniversary with the University! Wow how time absolutely flies, I remember graduating from MCPHS on a Saturday in May 2012 and starting work two days later on the Monday. I'm really grateful for the opportunities I've had at the University and I'm excited to see what the next 10 years will bring.

**August:** From COVID to Monkeypox...honestly what a scare this was to the LGBTQIA+ community. I knew a few people who ended up getting it and they said it was some of the most uncomfortable pain they've ever had. I'm very fortunate I was in Boston when the vaccines became available and I was able to get my first dose in August without too much trouble before I left for Carnival in Provincetown at the end of the month.

**September:** This year I was honored to have been chosen as a World Narcolepsy Day ambassador. I'm really excited to be able to help raise awareness for for those of us living with narcolepsy and and the challenges this invisible illness brings.

## The Not So Serious

**March:** March was my first trip of the year (and I finally after many years got to take the Amtrak to NYC!) Dominic and I were in the city celebrating our friend Brandon's birthday. While we were there, the four of us went to 30 Hudson Yards to the Edge NYC, 100-stories-high, glass-enclosed observation deck. It was a pretty cool experience and I'm glad they were able to convince me to go at night.

**May**: In my back and forth between Orlando and Boston for work, on this trip down to Orlando, Dominic and I finally made time to go to Sea World! This picture was taken right before we were drenched by the Orca and Dominic _assured_ me we weren't going to get wet despite the fact our seats said "Soak Zone".

Dominic also surprised me with a new Ghurka leather and brass tag for my briefcase, I'm glad he remembered I finished by doctorate a year ago already!

**June:** I was finally able this year to go visit by best friend from college in San Francisco. When he told me its been five years since we've last seen each other in person, I told him to shut up. Of course Jared, his partner Howe, and I had to visit some of the wineries in Sonoma County while I was in the area. Here we are at [Domaine Carneros], a winery in Napa Valley.

**July:** Well, July brings my birthday and this year Dominic took me to one of my favorite places, Key West, FL. We had such a great time, rented golf carts to get around all weekend, and I finally got to take him to some of my favorite spots there. I don't think I'll ever make that drive again, flying there is definitely the right way to go.

**August:** Waterfire! Anyone whose been to Providence knows about Waterfire, but if you haven't, it's a series of bonfires that are lit along the river in downtown Providence. It's a really cool night out and it was made even better by spending it with Dominic and my two best friends, Devan and Josh.

And come on, look at this view and vantage point we had, could it be anymore perfect?!

**September:** GAGA! Need I say more? I was so excited Dominic surprised me with tickets to see Lady Gaga in concert and even with the hours long rain delay, I was certainly not disappointed. She put on a great show and I elated to have been able to see her perform live at the last Chromatica Ball.

This trip home was probably my MOST favorite trip while I've been up north in Boston working this year. Dominic and I FINALLY after however long living in Florida, got to go to Disney World, Sea World, Animal Kingdom, Hollywood Studios, Epcot...you name it, we did it.

**October:** This year's National Coming Out Day was particularly special to me because I had the opportunity to meet one of my favorite drag queens, Silky Nutmeg Ganache.

**November:** The University is preparing to celebrate it's bicentennial in 2023 and they threw the first of many events to celebrate the occasion at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. It was great to see so many other faculty, staff, and their families there to celebrate the University's history.

## What's next?

I'm ready to see what 2023 has in store for me, but for now, that's all I have. Thanks for sticking around and reading this long, and I'll see you in 2023!

...and yes, I fell for the damn AI photos, but you know, I'm not mad about the result...
