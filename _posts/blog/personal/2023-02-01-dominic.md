Even though this is supposed to be my professional CV and research site, I felt as if this post was just as important as any of the others. I'm not sure if I'd ever be able to say these words, but here goes...

It’s with the heaviest of hearts today that I have to say my partner, Dominic, unfortunately passed away on the morning of January 10th. It’s surreal to be saying or typing those words just a few short weeks after his 27th birthday and there are simply no words to describe how heartbroken I am. Anyone who had the pleasure of meeting Dom, even for five minutes, knew he had the biggest heart matched only by his personality and smile that lit up any room. Dom was someone who never met a stranger, you were Instagram followers within minutes of meeting, and friends for life after that.

To my love: Dom, the past six years we’ve spent together have been nothing short of a dream and I can’t thank you enough for wanting to spend your life with me. From the second I saw you cross the street for our first date, I knew you were the one I wanted to spend the rest of my life with. You’ve shown me anything is possible if you trust your gut and take a leap. Words cannot express the love and happiness you brought to my life and to those around you.

I’ll love you always and forever babe, I promise.

❤️ Max and 🐾 Goose
