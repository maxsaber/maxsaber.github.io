## Course Description

This course will introduce the student to the uses of information technology, healthcare informatics, and data analytics as they apply within the healthcare sector. This course provides a hands‐on, working knowledge of the most common approaches used to describe and visualize population characteristics, and the basic statistical tests used to identify associations between variables within datasets. This course also introduces the use of “big‐data” sets from archival billing data sources to answer health care access and cost questions. Additionally, this course will utilize Tableau, an industry‐standard data visualization tool, to build reports and dashboards based on archival billing data.
